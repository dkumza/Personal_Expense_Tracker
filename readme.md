## Personal Expense Tracker

My very first "Expense tracker" project.
App will have 2 or 3 pages:

- 1st page will show Expenses review with Chart.js and transaction history.
- 2nd page will have field to enter or remove infomation and history list with maybe 4 or 6 last transactions.
- 3rd page?

What I wanna learn:

- Bootstrap CSS basics
- JS basics
- Chart.js basics

###### TO DO:

- [ ] Create 1st page of HTML layout
- [x] Add 2nd page of HTML layout
- [ ] 3rd page?
- [x] Create CSS by using Bootsrap CSS
- [x] JS: add/remove transactions (need to practice more)
- [x] JS: add/remove transactions to Local Storage (need to practice more)
- [ ] User Chart.js with data from local storage?
